/*
 * What is a BST? - It is a special type of binary tree, where,
 * 1. left subtree nodes < root
 * 2. right subtree nodes > root
 * 3. left subtree and right subtree are also BST with no duplicates
 * 
 * NOTE: Presence of duplicate in BST, is a special case.
 * 
 * Special Property: 
 * 1. Inorder traversal of BST gives a sorted sequence
 * 2. Search in a BST is of order O(h), where h is the height of the tree => O(log n)
